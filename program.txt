1. Our program will implement a simple 2D graphing calculator which will be able to graph simple
   functions
2. We expect the program to have multiple functions inside the same file (most likely one per 
   math function)
3. We expect the program to be approximately 200-300 lines of code
4. We think this will be a good illustration of the features because it will require use of all
   of the types and most of the control structures


Note: Because of the nature of wasm, we will have to implement the front-end stuff in js/css/html
